This dataset was requested from [CDC WONDER](https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D76;jsessionid=3A56137616CE09D4DD36FBC43324) in 45 separate requests. Each request was split by county, ICD-10 113 Causes List, and Year. All counties and demographics were included, the years 2010-2019 were included. To split the dataset into files that were less than 75,000 rows (a requirement set by CDC WONDER), I selected two to three causes of death from the ICD-10 113 Cause List, and requested, so that's what the names are for, i.e. c00-c16 2010-2019.txt selected Malignant neoplasms of lip, oral cavity, and pharynx (c00-c14) through malignant neoplasm of stomach (c16). 

This data will be used to find the suppression statistics from CDC WONDER (as in, data that is less than 10 deaths in a specific data point, i.e. a specific county in a specific year for a specific disease, will be "suppressed" for privacy issues. We want to find the diseases with low suppression counts, so that we can have the most data possible to extract meaningful insights.
